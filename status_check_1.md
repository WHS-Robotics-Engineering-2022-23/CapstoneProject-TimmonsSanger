Which parts of the project have you begun constructing to get to the final working solution?

We have began doing CAD for our project creating the fly wheel needed to shoot the nerf darts. We also have some of the simple electronics and sensors
coded.

Have you ordered all additional parts that will be needed?  When will they arrive if they have not already?

We don't need additonal parts that are ordered. All the parts we need are in the lab.

Have you designed any of the parts that will need to be manufactured?  If not, when will those designs be done?

We have started creating the fly wheel to shoot the nerf darts. We still need to design the parts that hold the components (the outer shell).

If you are able to complete the project by May 13th to your expectations, will you receive full credit in all five functional element categoriesLinks to an external site. (list how you meet each requirement)?

We should be able to meet all the requirments. Output display - RGB LED, LCD  Manual User Input - Remote system (Joystick, Button)  Automatic Sensors - UltraSonic Sensors, Actuator - Servo, Motor Logic - Programmed

What are the three most significant design challenges you foresee for this project?

The significant design challenges are the CAD shell, the shooting mechanism, and getting all the sensors to follow someone who is moving.
