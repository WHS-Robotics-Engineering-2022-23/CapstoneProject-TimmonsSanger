Robotics Engineering Capstone Project

We want to create a sort of turret that launches nerf bullets.
For the shooting mechanism we are thinking of using gears on a servo to move two
arms inwards twords the bullet. On the arms will be fast spining wheels that will grip the 
dart and shoot it out the front. We will have two modes. We will have a human control as well as an autonomous sentery mode. 
In sentery mode it will use the distance sensors to find a distance closer than it usually reads, using this on either side you can get the direction of movement. Than we can turn the flywheel to launch the bullets.
The human control will be easy using IR recievers to get a input and then you can shoot and turn left/right.
