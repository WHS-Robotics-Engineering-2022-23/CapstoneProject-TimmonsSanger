Robotics Engineering Capstone Project

We want to create a sort of turret that launches nerf bullets.
For the shooting mechanism we are thinking of using gears on a servo to move two
arms inwards twords the bullet. On the arms will be fast spining wheels that will grip the 
dart and shoot it out the front. We also want to incorperate this with a camera and a touch 
screen so you can move the turret and shoot. Not how do you move the turret? We are planning
on mounting the shooting mechanism on a servo the can turn the turret left and right.
