So far in our project we have used Arduino Web Editor, OnShape, and a variety of learning on sensors from many sites. One major site we have used is 
arduinomodules to learn how sensors work and get basic code for them. We as of now don't need to purchase any parts, however when it comes to manufactuing
we still need to work on our fly wheel system that shoots the bullets and refine it. We also need a housing to contain our parts such as the Arduino as well 
as places for the ultrasonic sensors. We also got a LED turning on and off with a IR reciever and a IR remote. This will be helpful for giving commands.
